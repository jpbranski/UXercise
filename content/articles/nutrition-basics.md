# Nutrition Basics for Strength Training

You can't out-train a poor diet. Proper nutrition is essential for building strength, recovering from workouts, and achieving your fitness goals.

## The Big Three: Macronutrients

### Protein

**Why it matters:**
Protein provides the building blocks (amino acids) for muscle repair and growth.

**How much:**
- Aim for 0.7-1.0 grams per pound of bodyweight
- Example: A 150 lb person needs 105-150g protein daily
- Spread intake throughout the day for optimal muscle protein synthesis

**Best sources:**
- Chicken breast
- Lean beef
- Fish (salmon, tuna, cod)
- Eggs
- Greek yogurt
- Cottage cheese
- Protein powder (whey, casein, or plant-based)
- Legumes and tofu (for vegetarians)

### Carbohydrates

**Why it matters:**
Carbs are your body's preferred fuel source for intense training. They replenish glycogen stores and support recovery.

**How much:**
- 1.5-3.0 grams per pound of bodyweight depending on activity level
- Higher on training days, can be lower on rest days

**Best sources:**
- Rice (white or brown)
- Oats
- Potatoes and sweet potatoes
- Pasta
- Bread
- Fruits
- Vegetables

### Fats

**Why it matters:**
Fats support hormone production, including testosterone, and help absorb fat-soluble vitamins.

**How much:**
- 0.3-0.5 grams per pound of bodyweight
- Don't go too low—fats are essential

**Best sources:**
- Olive oil
- Avocado
- Nuts and nut butters
- Fatty fish (salmon, mackerel)
- Eggs
- Cheese

## Calories: The Foundation

### For Muscle Gain (Bulking)

Eat in a caloric surplus:
- Start with TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) + 200-500 calories
- Gain 0.5-1 lb per week
- Monitor and adjust based on progress
- Focus on whole foods to minimize fat gain

### For Fat Loss (Cutting)

Eat in a caloric deficit:
- Start with TDEE - 300-500 calories
- Lose 0.5-1 lb per week
- Keep protein high (1g per lb) to preserve muscle
- Strength training helps maintain muscle during a cut

### For Maintenance (Recomposition)

Eat at maintenance calories:
- Beneficial for beginners who can build muscle and lose fat simultaneously
- Focus on consistent training and adequate protein
- Progress may be slower but sustainable

## Meal Timing and Frequency

### How Often to Eat

The total amount matters more than timing, but general guidelines:
- 3-5 meals per day works for most people
- Spread protein across meals (20-40g per meal)
- Eat based on your schedule and preferences

### Pre-Workout Nutrition

**2-3 hours before:**
- Balanced meal with protein, carbs, and moderate fat
- Example: Chicken, rice, and vegetables

**30-60 minutes before:**
- Light carbs for quick energy
- Example: Banana, rice cakes, or energy bar

### Post-Workout Nutrition

**Within 1-2 hours:**
- Protein and carbs to support recovery
- Example: Protein shake with fruit, or chicken with rice

The "anabolic window" isn't as critical as once thought—total daily intake matters most.

## Hydration

Water is essential for:
- Performance during workouts
- Recovery
- Overall health
- Nutrient transport

**Guidelines:**
- Drink 0.5-1 oz per pound of bodyweight daily
- More if you're training hard or in hot weather
- Clear or pale yellow urine indicates good hydration

## Supplements: What Actually Works

Most supplements are unnecessary, but these have solid evidence:

### Worth Considering

**Protein Powder**
- Convenient way to hit protein targets
- Not necessary if you can get enough from food
- Whey, casein, or plant-based options

**Creatine Monohydrate**
- 5g daily
- Improves strength and power output
- Most researched and effective supplement
- Inexpensive and safe

**Caffeine**
- Pre-workout boost for energy and focus
- 100-200mg before training
- Build tolerance, so cycle off periodically

**Vitamin D**
- Many people are deficient, especially in winter
- Supports bone health and immune function
- Get blood levels checked

### Probably Skip These

- BCAAs (redundant if you eat enough protein)
- Fat burners (mostly caffeine and marketing)
- Testosterone boosters (ineffective for natural lifters)
- Most pre-workout blends (overpriced caffeine)

## Practical Tips for Success

### Meal Prep

Batch cooking saves time and ensures you have healthy options ready:
- Cook 2-3 days of meals at once
- Use containers to portion meals
- Keep it simple: protein, carb, vegetable

### Easy High-Protein Meals

- Overnight oats with protein powder
- Greek yogurt with fruit and granola
- Scrambled eggs with toast
- Chicken breast with rice and broccoli
- Tuna sandwich on whole wheat
- Protein shake with banana and peanut butter

### Eating Out

- Order protein-based entrees
- Ask for vegetables as sides
- Don't be afraid to customize orders
- Track approximately, don't stress perfection

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Not eating enough protein**: This is the most common mistake
2. **Extreme dieting**: Slow and steady wins the race
3. **Ignoring vegetables**: Fiber and micronutrients matter
4. **Inconsistency**: Results come from sustained habits
5. **All-or-nothing thinking**: One bad meal doesn't ruin progress

## Tracking Your Nutrition

### Should You Track?

Tracking helps ensure you're hitting targets, but it's not for everyone.

**Pros:**
- Precise control over intake
- Learn portion sizes and food content
- Easier to adjust based on results

**Cons:**
- Can be time-consuming
- May lead to obsessive behaviors
- Not sustainable for everyone

**Alternatives:**
- Hand portion method (palm for protein, fist for carbs, etc.)
- Intuitive eating focused on whole foods
- Simplified tracking (just protein)

### Recommended Apps

- MyFitnessPal (free, comprehensive database)
- Cronometer (detailed micronutrient tracking)
- MacroFactor (adaptive coaching built-in)

## The Bottom Line

Nutrition doesn't have to be complicated:
1. Eat enough protein
2. Match calories to your goals
3. Eat mostly whole foods
4. Stay hydrated
5. Be consistent

Perfect is the enemy of good. Focus on building sustainable habits that you can maintain long-term.
